**Guide for giving Clint a new personality**
- Download `chat-responses.rkt`
- In this file is the heading `#| CLINT SPECIFIC |#
- Edit the strings under this heading. Make sure to leave the parentheses untouched.
- Save the file under the type of personality that you have given Clint, e.g. `nasty-responses.rkt` or similar.
Please keep in mind that you can ADD new responses, and that when editing already written responses, try to keep the meaning in tact while changing the tone of the text.
